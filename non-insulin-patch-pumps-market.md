<p><strong>The Non-insulin Patch Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Body Injectors</li><li>Off-Body Injectors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Non-insulin patch pumps are devices used for delivering medications to patients without the need for traditional injections. There are two main types of non-insulin patch pumps: on-body injectors and off-body injectors. On-body injectors are worn directly on the body and deliver medication through a small needle or cannula that penetrates the skin. Off-body injectors, on the other hand, allow for medication delivery without direct attachment to the body and are often worn on clothing or placed in a pocket. Both types offer convenience and reduce the discomfort associated with injections.</p></p>
