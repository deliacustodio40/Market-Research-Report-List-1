<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Oxygen Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Titanium oxide type</li><li>Zirconia type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive Oxygen Sensor market includes two main types: Titanium oxide type and Zirconia type. The Titanium oxide type sensor operates based on the principle of changes in the electrical conductivity of titanium dioxide when exposed to oxygen. This type is commonly used in older vehicle models. In contrast, the Zirconia type utilizes a ceramic material called zirconium dioxide to measure the oxygen content in the exhaust gas. This type is more precise and efficient, making it the preferred choice for modern vehicles.</p></p>
