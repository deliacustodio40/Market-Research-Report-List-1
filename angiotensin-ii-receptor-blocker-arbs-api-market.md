<p><ul><li>Essential Hypertension</li><li>Secondary Hypertension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are pharmaceutical ingredients used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure without any identifiable cause) and secondary hypertension (high blood pressure caused by an underlying medical condition). These ARBs work by blocking the effects of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels and increases blood pressure. By inhibiting angiotensin II, ARBs help relax blood vessels, reduce blood pressure, and alleviate hypertension in patients. These drugs play a crucial role in managing these conditions and improving cardiovascular health.</p></p>
