<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrogenated Rosin Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Partially Hydrogenated Rosin Resin</li><li>Highly Hydrogenated Rosin Resin</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hydrogenated Rosin Resins are derived from rosin, a natural resin obtained from pine trees. These resins are widely used in various applications, including adhesives, coatings, inks, and soldering fluxes. Partially Hydrogenated Rosin Resin refers to a type of hydrogenated rosin that has undergone a partial hydrogenation process, resulting in improved stability and higher softening point. On the other hand, Highly Hydrogenated Rosin Resin undergoes a more extensive hydrogenation process, offering even greater stability and a higher softening point than partially hydrogenated resins.</p></p>
