<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rebar Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fusion Bonded Epoxy Coated</li><li>Cement-polymer Composite Coated (CPCC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rebar coating market consists of two main types of coatings: fusion bonded epoxy coated and cement-polymer composite coated (CPCC). Fusion bonded epoxy coated rebar involves applying a layer of epoxy powder to the rebar surface and then heating it to create a strong, durable outer coating. CPCC, on the other hand, uses a combination of cement and polymer materials to form a protective layer on the rebar. Both coatings help to prevent corrosion and enhance the longevity of steel reinforcement in concrete structures.</p></p>
