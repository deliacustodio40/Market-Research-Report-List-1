<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Static VAR Compensator (SVC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thyristor-based</li><li>MCR-based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>A Static VAR Compensator (SVC) is a device used in electrical power systems to regulate voltage and control reactive power. There are two main types of SVC market: thyristor-based and MCR-based. Thyristor-based SVCs use thyristor-controlled reactors and capacitors to vary the reactive power. MCR-based SVCs, on the other hand, use mechanically switched capacitors and reactors. Both types operate similarly by injecting or absorbing reactive power to stabilize the system voltage. However, thyristor-based SVCs are more flexible and efficient, whereas MCR-based SVCs are simpler and less expensive.</p></p>
