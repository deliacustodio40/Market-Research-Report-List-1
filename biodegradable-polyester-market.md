<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biodegradable Polyester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Homopolymer (PHA, PHB, PLA, PCL)</li><li>Copolymer (PBS, PHBV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biodegradable polyester market consists of two main types: homopolymer and copolymer. Homopolymers include substances like polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), polylactic acid (PLA), and polycaprolactone (PCL). These polymers are made from a single type of monomer and exhibit specific properties depending on the monomer used. On the other hand, copolymers like polybutylene succinate (PBS) and polyhydroxybutyrate-valerate (PHBV) are made from two or more different monomers, resulting in enhanced properties and performance compared to homopolymers.</p></p>
