<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portland Limestone Cements Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standard Consistency</li><li>Extra Thick Consistency</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Portland Limestone Cements (PLCs) are a type of cement used in the construction industry. The market for PLCs can be divided into two types based on consistency: standard consistency and extra thick consistency. Standard consistency refers to the normal consistency level of PLCs, which is determined by the water amount required to achieve a specific viscosity. On the other hand, extra thick consistency PLCs have a higher water requirement, resulting in a thicker and more viscous mixture. These different consistencies cater to varying construction needs and provide flexibility in application.</p></p>
