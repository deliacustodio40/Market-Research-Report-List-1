<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pot Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Free Sliding Pot Bearing</li><li>Fixed Pot Bearing</li><li>Guided Pot Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pot bearings are commonly used in architectural and civil engineering projects to facilitate movement and transfer loads between structures. The pot bearing market can be classified into three types: </p><p>1. Free Sliding Pot Bearing: This type allows unobstructed sliding between the upper and lower plates, enabling horizontal movement.</p><p>2. Fixed Pot Bearing: Unlike free sliding bearings, these provide resistance to horizontal movement, ensuring the plates remain fixed.</p><p>3. Guided Pot Bearing: These bearings allow limited horizontal movement by using guide fixtures, preventing excessive displacement while retaining some freedom of motion.</p></p>
