<p><strong>The Die Casting Lubricants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Chamber Machines</li><li>Cold chamber Machines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Die casting lubricants are essential in both hot chamber machines and cold chamber machines. Hot chamber machines utilize a closed system where the molten metal is directly poured into the die cavity. The lubricant helps in reducing friction between the metal and the die, ensuring smooth flow during the casting process. On the other hand, in cold chamber machines, the molten metal is ladled into the shot sleeve. The lubricant prevents sticking and adhesion between the metal and the shot sleeve, facilitating easy removal of the casted product.</p></p>
