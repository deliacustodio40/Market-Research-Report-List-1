<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicone Transformer Fuid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Silicon Oil</li><li>Modified Silicon Oil</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Silicone transformer fluid is used as an insulating material in electrical transformers. There are two types of silicone transformer fluid: straight silicon oil and modified silicon oil. Straight silicon oil is a standard silicone fluid, while modified silicon oil is enhanced with additives to improve its performance and characteristics. Both types of fluid offer excellent dielectric properties, high thermal stability, and low flammability. However, modified silicon oil provides additional benefits such as better oxidation resistance and extended lifespan, making it a preferred choice in certain transformer applications.</p></p>
