<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Insulating Glass (VIG) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tempered VIG</li><li>Non-tempered VIG</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Vacuum Insulating Glass (VIG) is a type of glass designed to provide excellent insulation for buildings. It consists of two glass panes separated by a vacuum seal, which minimizes heat transfer. The market for VIG is categorized into two types - Tempered VIG and Non-tempered VIG. Tempered VIG refers to glass that has undergone a tempering process to increase its strength and resistance to breaking. Non-tempered VIG, on the other hand, does not go through this process. Both types offer superior insulation but differ in terms of their durability and resistance to breakage.</p></p>
