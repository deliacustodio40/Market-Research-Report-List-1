<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metallic Paint/Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metallic paint/coating market consists of two main types: solvent-based and water-based. Solvent-based metallic paint is composed of solvents, which evaporate during the drying process, leaving behind a glossy finish. This type of paint offers high durability and resistance to moisture and chemicals. On the other hand, water-based metallic paint uses water as a base instead of solvents and is more environmentally friendly. It provides easy clean up with soap and water and emits fewer volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during application, making it a safer choice.</p></p>
