<p><strong>The Tire Retreading for Commercial Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre Cure</li><li>Mold Cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tire retreading is a cost-effective solution for commercial vehicles to prolong tire life and reduce expenses. There are two main market types for retreading: pre-cure and mold cure. Pre-cure retreading involves applying a pre-vulcanized tread to a cured casing, which is then bonded through heat in a chamber. This method allows for better tread depth control and uniformity. On the other hand, mold cure retreading involves applying uncured tread rubber onto a casing, which is then placed in a mold and subjected to heat and pressure. This process provides excellent bonding between the casing and tread, resulting in increased durability.</p></p>
