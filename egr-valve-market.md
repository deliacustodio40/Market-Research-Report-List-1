<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EGR Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Electronically Controlled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve market can be categorized into two types: Mechanical and Electronically Controlled. In mechanical EGR valves, the flow of exhaust gas is controlled by a mechanical device like a vacuum or diaphragm system. They are simpler in design and operation but may have limited control over the recirculated gas flow. In contrast, electronically controlled EGR valves utilize sensors and electronic systems to precisely control the flow of exhaust gas, improving performance and emission control. They are more advanced and offer better control and efficiency.</p></p>
