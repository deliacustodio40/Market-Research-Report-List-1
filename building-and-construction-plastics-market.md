<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Building and Construction Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting Plastics</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Building and Construction Plastics are widely used in various applications within the industry. There are two main types: Thermoplastics and Thermosetting Plastics. </p><p>Thermoplastics are materials that can be melted and re-molded multiple times without changing their chemical composition. They have high flexibility, can be easily shaped, and exhibit excellent impact resistance. Common examples include polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polypropylene.</p><p>On the other hand, Thermosetting Plastics undergo a chemical change during the curing process, rendering them rigid and non-malleable. Once set, they cannot be melted or re-molded. These materials provide excellent heat and chemical resistance, making them suitable for applications such as pipes, electrical insulation, and laminates. Examples include epoxy resins, phenolic resins, and melamine formaldehyde.</p></p>
