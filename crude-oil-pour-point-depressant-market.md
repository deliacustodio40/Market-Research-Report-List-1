<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crude Oil Pour Point Depressant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymeric Depressant</li><li>Surfactant Depressant</li><li>Compound Depressant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crude oil pour point depressants are additives used to lower the freezing point, or pour point, of crude oil. There are three main types of pour point depressants in the market. Polymeric depressants are polymers that modify the wax crystal structure in the oil, preventing them from forming a solid gel. Surfactant depressants reduce the interfacial tension between the wax crystals and the oil, preventing their agglomeration. Compound depressants are a combination of both polymeric and surfactant depressants, providing a dual action mechanism to lower the pour point of crude oil.</p></p>
