<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminium-extruded Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mill-Finished</li><li>Anodized</li><li>Powder-Coated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aluminium-extruded products market offers three main types of finishes: mill-finished, anodized, and powder-coated. Mill-finished products have a raw, untreated surface straight from the extrusion process. Anodized products undergo an electrochemical process to create a protective layer on the surface, enhancing corrosion resistance and providing a range of color options. Powder-coated products are coated with a dry powder that is melted and fused onto the surface, offering enhanced durability, color options, and resistance to fading, scratching, and chipping. These different finishes cater to various aesthetic preferences and functional requirements in the market.</p></p>
