<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dual-clutch Transmission Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Clutch</li><li>Wet Clutch</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Dual-clutch transmission (DCT) is a type of gearbox that provides faster and smoother gear shifts compared to traditional automatic transmissions. The DCT market can be categorized into two types: dry clutch and wet clutch. The dry clutch system uses plates that are not immersed in oil, resulting in lower friction and higher fuel efficiency. On the other hand, the wet clutch system has the plates immersed in oil, which improves cooling and allows for better power transmission but may slightly reduce fuel efficiency.</p></p>
