<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Rubber Hot Melt Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HTV</li><li>RTV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic Rubber Hot Melt Adhesive (SRHMA) is used in various industries and can be categorized into two types: High-temperature vulcanization (HTV) and Room-temperature vulcanization (RTV) markets. HTV adhesives require heat and pressure to form a strong bond, making them suitable for applications like automotive and construction. RTV adhesives, on the other hand, cure at ambient temperature and are commonly used in electronics and medical fields. Both types offer durable adhesion, but HTV is more heat-resistant while RTV provides greater flexibility after curing.</p></p>
