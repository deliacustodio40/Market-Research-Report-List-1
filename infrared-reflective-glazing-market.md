<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Reflective Glazing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-Coat IRR Glazing</li><li>IRR Glazing with IR Film</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Infrared Reflective Glazing is categorized into two main types: Direct-Coat IRR Glazing and IRR Glazing with IR Film. Direct-Coat IRR Glazing refers to a process where a special coating is directly applied to the glass during manufacturing, allowing it to reflect infrared radiation and reduce heat transfer. On the other hand, IRR Glazing with IR Film involves applying a thin film with infrared reflective properties onto a pre-existing glass surface, achieving similar heat reduction benefits. Both methods offer effective solutions for improving energy efficiency and reducing heat buildup in buildings.</p></p>
