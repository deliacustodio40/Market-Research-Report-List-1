<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry-type Transformer Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Top Blowing Type</li><li>Side Blowing Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The dry-type transformer fan market consists of two types: top blowing type and side blowing type. In top blowing type, the fan is positioned on top of the transformer and blows air downwards onto the transformer. This allows for efficient cooling and reduces the risk of dust accumulation. On the other hand, in side blowing type, the fan is positioned on the side of the transformer and blows air horizontally across the transformer's windings. This type is preferred when space constraints restrict the use of top blowing fans.</p></p>
