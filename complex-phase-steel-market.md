<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Complex Phase Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold-rolled CP Steel</li><li>Hot-rolled CP Steel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Complex Phase (CP) steel is a type of steel known for its high strength and excellent formability. It is widely used in the automotive industry for manufacturing high-strength structural components. There are two main market types of CP steel: cold-rolled CP steel and hot-rolled CP steel. Cold-rolled CP steel is produced by further processing hot-rolled steel through cold rolling, resulting in increased strength and improved surface finish. Hot-rolled CP steel, on the other hand, is produced by heating the steel above its recrystallization temperature and then rolling it into the desired shape, resulting in a higher ductility and toughness.</p></p>
