<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NI 5.0</li><li>NI 4.8</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the nitrogen market, two common types are NI 5.0 and NI 4.8. NI 5.0 refers to nitrogen gas with a purity level of 99.999%, while NI 4.8 refers to nitrogen gas with a purity level of 99.998%. These purity levels indicate the amount of impurities present in the gas. NI 5.0 is considered a high-purity nitrogen gas used in industries that require extremely clean processes, such as electronics manufacturing. On the other hand, NI 4.8 is still of high quality and suits applications that don't require the same level of purity as NI 5.0.</p></p>
