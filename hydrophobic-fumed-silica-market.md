<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrophobic Fumed Silica Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hydrophobic fumed silica is a type of fumed silica that has been chemically modified to repel water. Type I hydrophobic fumed silica is typically treated with dimethyldichlorosilane, resulting in high hydrophobicity. It is widely used in applications such as coatings, adhesives, and sealants due to its excellent compatibility. On the other hand, type II hydrophobic fumed silica is modified with hexamethyldisilazane, providing a moderate hydrophobicity level. It is commonly used in applications like silicone rubber, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, where a lower level of hydrophobicity is required.</p></p>
