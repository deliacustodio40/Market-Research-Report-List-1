<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zinc Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Non Rotatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Zinc sputtering targets are used in various industries, and their market is divided into two types: rotary type and non-rotatable type. The rotary type refers to sputtering targets that rotate during the deposition process, allowing for a more uniform coating on the substrate. This type is commonly used in applications that require a large coating area or high sputtering rates. On the other hand, the non-rotatable type targets remain stationary during deposition and are ideal for applications where precise control over the coating thickness is crucial or when dealing with fragile substrates.</p></p>
