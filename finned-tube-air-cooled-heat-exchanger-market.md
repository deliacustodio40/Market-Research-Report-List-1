<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Finned Tube Air Cooled Heat Exchanger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Longitudinal Type</li><li>Transverse Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Finned tube air cooled heat exchangers are used to transfer heat between two fluids, typically involving air and a liquid or gas. These heat exchangers come in two main types - longitudinal and transverse. Longitudinal type heat exchangers have finned tubes aligned in parallel to the airflow direction, allowing for effective heat transfer. Transverse type heat exchangers have finned tubes aligned perpendicular to the airflow direction. Both types improve heat transfer rates by increasing surface area. The choice between the two types depends on the specific application and space limitations.</p></p>
